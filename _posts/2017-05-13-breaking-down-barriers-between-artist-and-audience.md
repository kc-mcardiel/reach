<p>At the end of February, there was a significant concrete pour to lay the foundation for the three pavilions. As of the beginning of May, the pavilions are starting to rise and visibly take shape. Seeing forms coming out of the ground inspires the artistic and educational programming teams to explore even more fully the many ideas surrounding activating the expansion.</p>

<p>Walking through expansion will provide a window into the artistic experience—quite literally. In the new space, visitors will be able to peer into studio after studio and catch a glimpse of professional artists perfecting their craft or community groups engaging with a new art form. According to the Kennedy Center’s Director of Dance Programming, Meg Booth, the new spaces will “enrich the relationships we have within our community” and will create new opportunities for arts education, interactivity with the arts, and civic engagement.</p>

<p>Remember&nbsp;<em>Finding a Line</em>—the 2015 skateboarding festival at the Center that highlighted the intersection of an American subculture with a multitude of art forms, but also attracted improvisers/ innovators? The expanded campus will continue to take those ideas (merging vibrant music genres, showcasing new ideas, and exploring how one’s physical surroundings influence an art form) and amplify them.</p>

<p>A good percentage of the programming that will fill the spaces will be education-focused. According to Meg Booth, the education programs will most likely follow a three-pronged approach to ensure that everyone is able to participate—from a post-performance discussion to a Master Class. There will be programs for the aspirational or those who are new to the arts, for the active or those who have been exposed to some form of artistic training, and for the activated or those in pre-professional programs.</p>

<p>The programming and education departments are currently talking with professional and community groups about ways to “breathe life into the space” and truly activate the campus. Even though the scope of programming is not ready to be unveiled, one thing is certain: the expansion’s completion will be the beginning of a new era for the Center—an era that is defined by the convergence of artist and audience.</p>
