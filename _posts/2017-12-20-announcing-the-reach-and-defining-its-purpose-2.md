<p>When approaching the Kennedy Center from Memorial  Bridge or along the Potomac River on the footpath from Georgetown or the  National Mall, the view of swiveling cranes and newly pitched walls gives an  exciting glimpse of the fast-changing landscape on the most western edge of the  District. </p>

<p>The Center is building the future with the first  major physical expansion in its history, now named the REACH—a nod to President  Kennedy’s inspirational and aspirational vision for human potential. The REACH’s  expansive campus will serve as a model for a 21st-century performing arts  center, offering visitors the chance to <strong>R</strong>enew, <strong>E</strong>xperience, <strong>A</strong>ctivate, <strong>C</strong>reate, and <strong>H</strong>onor the legacy of President John F.  Kennedy and immerse themselves in the power of the performing arts. </p>

<p>The REACH will be a noisy, active place that brings  the full range of the performing arts to audiences while emphasizing both the  creative process and arts learning. Renowned American architect Steven Holl’s innovative,  highly flexible design complements the silhouette of the current original  building and adds breathtaking outdoor spaces, as well as three distinct pavilions  overlooking the Potomac River. </p>
