<p>Here are some of the sustainable building features that were incorporated into the project broken out by&nbsp;<strong>LEED Project Categories</strong>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":1} -->
<h1 id="1d25"><strong>Sustainable Sites&nbsp;</strong>✅</h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>The Kennedy Center is inherently sustainable</strong>&nbsp;based on our urban location. There are many neighborhood amenities within a half-mile walking distance including the Lincoln Memorial, restaurants, dry cleaners, and places of worship.</li><li>Patrons and performers are encouraged to use&nbsp;<strong>public transit</strong>&nbsp;as an alternative to personal vehicles.</li><li><strong>Low-emitting, fuel-efficient vehicles</strong>&nbsp;are provided with electric vehicle charging stations in our parking garage.</li><li>The landscape was designed to<strong>&nbsp;promote biodiversity and protect natural habitat</strong>.</li><li>Rainwater is typically piped away, causing sewers to be overloaded and leading to flooding during large storms. We took a different approach at the REACH and&nbsp;<strong>reduced the amount of runoff by almost 60%</strong>, using native and adapted vegetation.</li><li>The REACH building&nbsp;<strong>mitigates heat absorption&nbsp;</strong>by locating all parking underground, primarily under vegetated roofing.</li></ul>

<!-- wp:heading {"level":1} -->
<h1 id="2172"><strong>Water Efficiency&nbsp;</strong>✅</h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Water conserving plumbing fixtures are installed including dual-flush toilets, pint-flush urinals, low-flow showers, and kitchen faucets. These fixtures&nbsp;<strong>reduce water consumption by about 130,000 gallons per year</strong>, almost 40% compared to conventional building fixtures!</li></ul>

<h1 id="60aa"><strong>Energy &amp; Atmosphere&nbsp;</strong>✅</h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>An&nbsp;<strong>energy efficient hybrid system&nbsp;</strong>was designed to create supplemental cooling and heating with a closed-loop geothermal system to reduce the environmental impact associated with grid-sourced energy.</li><li>The REACH building is served with chilled water from the existing Kennedy Center chiller plant, which consists of&nbsp;<strong>four 800-ton chillers</strong>, cooled by condenser water from the Potomac River.</li><li>Ventilation is partially provided by&nbsp;<strong>energy-efficient</strong>&nbsp;displacement ventilation.</li><li><strong>Energy-efficiency</strong>&nbsp;measures for lighting include stand-alone and room-based lighting controls for interior spaces such as rehearsal rooms, studios, offices, and back-of-house room.</li><li>Radiant systems, ground source heat pump, and low-E windows resulted in a<strong>&nbsp;modeled energy savings of 20%</strong>&nbsp;over a similar conventionally designed building.</li><li>Refrigerants in cooling systems can cause ozone depletion and contribute to global warming. Refrigerants for the new air conditioning and heat pumps, in addition to the central plan chillers, were selected to&nbsp;<strong>minimize these effects</strong>.</li><li>We opted to “green” our power source for the REACH by&nbsp;<strong>offsetting 35% of the total annual electricity use</strong>.</li></ul>

<h1 id="e1c8"><strong>Materials &amp; Resources&nbsp;</strong>✅</h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Recycling receptacles</strong>&nbsp;for paper/corrugated cardboard, glass, plastic, and metal are located throughout the building.</li><li>More than&nbsp;<strong>75% of all construction waste was recycled</strong>&nbsp;rather than sent to the landfill.</li><li>More than&nbsp;<strong>10% of the materials used to construct the building contain recycled content</strong>. Over 20% of the building materials were manufactured and extracted within a 500-mile radius of the building.</li></ul>

<h1 id="9960"><strong>Indoor Environmental Quality&nbsp;</strong>✅</h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Low-emitting paints, sealants, and flooring</strong>&nbsp;were used to protect the health and well-being of our patrons from the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are typically found in these products, which negatively affect respiration.</li><li>The Kennedy Center has a&nbsp;<strong>strict no smoking policy</strong>. No smoking is allowed inside the building or on the Entrance Plaza in front of the building.</li><li>To ensure clean air in the breathing zone similar to outdoors levels of carbon dioxide,&nbsp;<strong>CO2 detectors are installed in all densely occupied spaces</strong>, and outdoor airflow measurement devices are located in other spaces.</li><li>Additional measures to improve the indoor air quality (IAQ) include the dedicated outside air system that provides&nbsp;<strong>30% more ventilation than ASHRAE standards</strong>, high filtration and walk-off systems at building entrances to trap dirt from entering the building.</li><li>Spaces are designed to optimize temperature and humidity, and&nbsp;<strong>100% of occupants can control the lighting in their spaces</strong>&nbsp;by using dimmers, switching, and vacancy sensors.</li><li>To further a commitment to occupant health and well-being, the Kennedy Center has a Green Housekeeping policy which requires<strong>&nbsp;less toxic cleaning products and practices</strong>.</li></ul>
