The
REACH is a place where visitors, audiences and artists can come together for
collaboration, experimentation, and exploration in the spirit of President
Kennedy’s vision for a new frontier for the arts. Many of the spaces have been
named after historical and personal moments in his life as an expression of our
role as his living memorial.
