<p>On the B Level (the ground floor for most of the project), all of the underlying site utilities are finished and nearly every wall is complete. While work proceeds on the site, the project team also continues to perfect the white, board-formed concrete that is used to construct the three pavilions, such as the Skylight Pavilion.</p>
