<p>Construction has progressed rapidly, giving our  patrons a sneak peek at the future silhouette of the Kennedy Center campus.  Recently seen on the Center’s Expansion Cam, carpenters have completed the  ceiling forms for Studio A, the largest studio in the REACH. To ensure a  perfect product, the team created many mock-up ceiling forms for their “saw  tooth” design. The unique shape of these ridges will diffuse sound throughout  the concrete ceiling while adding structural strength.</p>

<p>Large, built-in lighting fixtures will be housed  between the ridges, as well as several theatrical lighting bars that will allow  the studio to transition from a casual daytime master class, to an elegant and  intimate jazz performance. Since the form remains outdoors during construction,  the wide black pipes that create the circular openings to house lighting  fixtures got their own yellow rain jackets!</p>

<p>On top of this concrete ceiling will be the Upper  Lawn, where patrons and visitors can relax outdoors and enjoy films, recorded  or live simulcast performances, and other projected pieces.</p>
