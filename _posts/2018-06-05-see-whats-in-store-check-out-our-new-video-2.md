<p>Today, the Kennedy Center announced that the REACH—its ongoing expansion project—will open to the public on September 7, 2019. At a hard hat tour attended by civic and cultural leaders from across the Washington, D.C. region, Kennedy Center leadership unveiled its programmatic vision for the REACH, with President Deborah F. Rutter commenting:</p>

<p>“The REACH will be transformational for the Kennedy Center, for our artists, and especially for our visitors. As the nation’s cultural center, the Kennedy Center strives to reflect and advance the cultural interests of our community. More and more, today’s audiences crave connection—with art and with each other—while artists and arts organizations desire customized spaces that nurture their creative endeavors. The REACH will fulfill many of those needs, all within a one-of-a-kind design that is a work of art in and of itself. We imagine an energized, active space where visitors can go behind the scenes, observe an intimate performance, or simply sit and enjoy the stunning architecture and river views, surrounded by the energy of art in progress. We cannot wait to open our doors on September 7, 2019.”</p>

<p>Envisioned as a complement to, and extension of, the Kennedy Center’s mission, the REACH will support both artistic and educational programming, with a strong emphasis on supporting artists, new works, and artistic development for artists at all levels. With its open and interconnected design, the REACH’s unique design offers unprecedented public access to rehearsals and works-in-progress, and provides much-needed rehearsal and classroom space for new and existing Kennedy Center programs.</p>

<p>At today’s event, performances by local arts groups highlighted some of the ways the space will be used. Student dancers from Duke Ellington School for the Arts performed in Studio C, while the Voices of Inspiration Choir performed in the River Pavilion overlooking the Potomac. In the Welcome Pavilion, a string trio from the National Symphony Orchestra greeted guests.</p>

<p>Regular activities within the REACH will include club-style performances, a Learning Lab that welcomes students and visitors to explore hands-on arts experiences, and social events, as well as festivals, outdoor films, art installations, and exhibitions. Beginning in Summer 2020, the REACH is expected to host a variety of arts-focused summer camps for young people.</p>

<p>The REACH will open to the public on September 7, 2019, with a weeklong celebration that features free campus-wide activities, indoor and outdoor performances and events across the entire Kennedy Center campus, and extensive opportunities for the public to explore Washington’s newest cultural destination.</p>
