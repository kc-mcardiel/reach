<p>The construction site is undergoing a drastic transformation. Beyond the installation of more underlying infrastructure and the emergence of internal and external building framework, the uniquely crafted crinkle concrete, a textured and acoustically-sound material designed specifically for the walls of the expansion, is visible from the surrounding area.<br><br>Additionally, construction on the foundation for the new entrance to the parking garage is underway. This entrance will ensure accessibility and ease when travelling to, from, and through the expansion buildings and the Kennedy Centerâ€™s main facilities. </p>
