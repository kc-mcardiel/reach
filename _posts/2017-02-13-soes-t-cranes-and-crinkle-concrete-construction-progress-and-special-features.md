<p>In December, the Kennedy Center hit a major milestone for the expansion project. A second tower crane (t-crane) was erected on the west side of the jobsite. The new tower crane is shorter than the first, but has a larger boom (horizontal part of the crane that carries the load). Both tower cranes are being used primarily by the concrete subcontractor to move reinforcing steel (more commonly known as “rebar”—short for reinforcing bar), formwork, and concrete efficiently across the large site.</p>

<p>Excavation for the new ramp to the garage is extensive—the steel and wood structure is holding back the surrounding soil. These systems are referred to as shoring or “support of excavation” ( SOE for short). The SOE walls consist of steel piles and wood lagging. The steel from wall to wall is cross-bracing, which is required to provide the strength necessary to hold back the soil.</p>

<p>The expansion team uses a sophisticated monitoring system to ensure everything is staying where it should. Each pile has a “target” that is measured by an automated survey device known as a “total station.” The station automatically checks each target at regular intervals throughout the day and night, measuring the distance from the station to the target. If the station detects that a new measurement is off by just a fraction of an inch from the last measurement, it will send text messages and emails to alert key members of the project team that something is off. The team then responds and examines the situation in the field to see if there’s anything that requires action.</p>

<p>One unique facet of the project that is just beginning to take shape is a special concrete form which will help to break up sound in rooms with parallel walls. The studios &amp; multi-use spaces will have “crinkle concrete,” a Kennedy Center-exclusive design created by Steven Holl Architects. The random texture of the crinkle concrete will deflect sound waves, preventing them from bouncing back and forth between smooth, parallel walls. Essentially, sound will not travel between rooms and disrupt other activities that are in process.</p>
